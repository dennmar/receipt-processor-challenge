# Receipt Processor

A webservice that stores and scores receipts, fulfilling the documented API. The API is described below. A formal definition is provided
in the [api.yml](./api.yml) file. Note that the 400 Bad Request and 404 Not Found responses from the webservice deviate from the
[api.yml](./api.yml) file in favor of a more informative error description.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing [compose.yaml](./compose.yaml) and the files above.
2. Start the application by running `docker compose up web`.

   The output on the terminal should be similar to this:
   ```
   [+] Building 0.0s (0/0)                                      docker:default
   [+] Running 1/0
    ✔ Container receipt-processor-challenge-web-1  Created                0.0s
   Attaching to receipt-processor-challenge-web-1

   receipt-processor-challenge-web-1  | [2025-04-27 20:18:21 +0000] [1] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8000 (1)

   receipt-processor-challenge-web-1  | [2025-04-27 20:18:21 +0000] [7] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 7
   ```
3. Open another terminal and store a receipt with a POST request to `/receipts/process`. The JSON in the request should match the format of
   [simple-receipt.json](./examples/simple-receipt.json). For example, you can run the following command:
   ```
   curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -X POST \
        -d '{
          "retailer": "Target", "purchaseDate": "2022-01-01",
          "purchaseTime": "13:01",
          "items": [
              {
                  "shortDescription": "Mountain Dew 12PK",
                  "price": "6.49"
              },{
                  "shortDescription": "Emils Cheese Pizza",
                  "price": "12.25"
              },{
                  "shortDescription": "Knorr Creamy Chicken",
                  "price": "1.26"
              },{
                  "shortDescription": "Doritos Nacho Cheese",
                  "price": "3.35"
              },{
                  "shortDescription": "   Klarbrunn 12-PK 12 FL OZ  ",
                  "price": "12.00"
              }
            ],
            "total": "35.35"
          }' \
        localhost:8000/receipts/process
   ```
   If you ran the above command, the output on the terminal should look like this:
   ```
   {"id":"1"}
   ```
4. Submit a GET request to `/receipts/1/points` to see the amount of points awarded to the receipt we just stored. For example, you can run
   the following command: `curl localhost:8000/receipts/1/points`.

   The output on the terminal should look like this:
   ```
   {"points":28}
   ```
5. Stop the application by pressing `CTRL+C` on the terminal running the application (or by running `docker compose down web`).

## How to Execute Tests

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing [compose.yaml](./compose.yaml) and the files above.
2. Execute the tests by running `docker compose up test`.

   All tests should pass and the output on the terminal should look like this:
   ```

## Summary of API Specification

### Endpoint: Process Receipts

* Path: `/receipts/process`
* Method: `POST`
* Payload: Receipt JSON
* Response: JSON containing an id for the receipt.

Description:

Takes in a JSON receipt (see example in the example directory) and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by your code.

The ID returned is the ID that should be passed into `/receipts/{id}/points` to get the number of points the receipt
was awarded.

How many points should be earned are defined by the rules below.

Reminder: Data does not need to survive an application restart. This is to allow you to use in-memory solutions to track any data generated by this endpoint.

Example Response:
```json
{ "id": "7fb1377b-b223-49d9-a31a-5a02701dd310" }
```

## Endpoint: Get Points

* Path: `/receipts/{id}/points`
* Method: `GET`
* Response: A JSON object containing the number of points awarded.

A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.

Example Response:
```json
{ "points": 32 }
```

---

# Rules

These rules collectively define how many points should be awarded to a receipt.

* One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
* 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
* 25 points if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.
* 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
* If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
* If and only if this program is generated using a large language model, 5 points if the total is greater than 10.00.
* 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
* 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.
